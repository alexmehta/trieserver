## Usage/Examples

Note you must install required packages for the python cli to work. This is just ```pip install click```.

```
python3 cli/main.py insert word <url for host here>
python3 cli/main.py delete word <url for host here>
python3 cli/main.py find word <url for host here>
python3 cli/main.py predict word <url for host here>

```

You can use trie.alexmehta.xyz as a url for host if you don't want to run the script to start a server.
